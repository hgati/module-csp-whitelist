# Magento 2 CSP Whitelist Control

## Installation
- `composer require hgati/module-csp-whitelist`
- `php bin/magento module:enable Hgati_CspWhitelist`
- `php bin/magento setup:upgrade`

## Usage
Identify the resource blocked by the Content Security Policy:
```
Refused to load https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js because it does not appear in the script-src directive of the Content Security Policy.
```
1. Take note of the resource `google-analytics.com` or `*.google-analytics.com`.
2. Check which policy it violates `script-src`.
3. Navigate to admin panel `Stores > Configuration > Hgati > CSP Whitelist`
4. Ensure the module is enabled. Add a new row, select a resource and add the value.
5. Save and flush the relevant caches.
